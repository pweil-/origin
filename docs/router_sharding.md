- how are shards configured
- how is router configuration visualized from a user perspective
- how is a shard chosen for a route
- how is a user notified of a route allocation and final dns
- how does a user request default dns name vs custom dns name
- re-allocation, does it ever occur
- router fronting with DNS, how are entries created

## Description

As an application administrator, I would like my routes to be configured with shards so they can grow beyond a single
active/active or active/passive setup.  I should be able to configure many routers to allocate user requested
routes to and be able to visualize the configuration.  

## Constraints

- Router re-allocation is out of scope for this proposal.  When using DNS to front routers you must deal
with the client caching feature that is unpredictable. 


## Use Cases

The following use cases should be satisfied by this proposal:

1. Create multiple routers with shards
1. User requests default route for application
1. User requests custom route for application
1. Create DNS (or other front end entry points) for routers

## Creating Sharded Routers

Options for creating a sharded router must answer the following questions:
 
- Where should config live?
- How are shards configured?
- How does OpenShift know about routers (for route allocation)?

#### Option 1: Router is administered as a pod

Administering the router as a pod and *NOT* as a custom top level object allows a quick implementation but reduces
the ability to visualize the router infrastructure and deal with it with commands specific to routers.  This option
means that configuration visualization needs to be provided through the `inspect` or `describe` commands or by providing
hooks into the router containers or storage mechanisms (etcd) so that routers can be visualized as a complete unit or
as individual routers.

- Where does configuration live: etcd, just like any other pod
- How are shards configured: shards are configured via environment variables
- How does OpenShift know about routers (for route allocation): routers must be registered with OpenShift via convention 
or configuration.

Pros: 

- default infra 
- less custom code, config syntax fits nicely into container env vars

Cons: 

- unable to provide custom commands and visualization through the CLI
- the system doesn't know about routers by default, they need to be registered somehow for route allocation

#### Option 2: Router is a top level object

Administering routers as a top level object allows administrators to use custom commands specific to routers.  This provides
a more use friendly mechanism of configuration and customizing routers.  However, this also introduces more code for 
an object that will likely be dealt with as a pod anyway.  Routers should be a low touch configuration item that do not
require many custom commands for daily administration.

- Where does configuration live: etcd, just like any other pod
- How are shards configured: shards are configured via custom commands and `json` syntax
- How does OpenShift know about routers (for route allocation): routers are known to OpenShift at create time

Pros: 

- custom administration syntax
- deal with routers as infra
- the system knows about routers for route allocation with no extra effort

Cons: 

- more divergent from Kubernetes codebase which is generally bad

#### Option 3: Hybrid

Routers could be administered with custom commands in the OpenShift client and still *NOT* be top level objects.  This 
allows administrators to create and administer routers via the CLI, allows the system to explicitly know about routers 
when they are created, and allows more robust visualization commands.

- Where does configuration live: etcd, just like any other pod
- How are shards configured: shards are configured via environment variables as in the pod scenario and only created 
with custom commands like `create router`
- How does OpenShift know about routers (for route allocation): routers are known to OpenShift at create time

Pros: 

- custom administration syntax
- deal with routers as infra
- the system knows about routers for route allocation with no extra effort

Cons: 

- possibly confusing that you can administer a router via custom commands or the existing pod commands

## User Requests a Route

when they have their own dns name then need to point it to our nameservers, map their dns to a shard name with a c record?
when requesting default dns we should take the name, allocate it, and provide then a final dns name?


## Create DNS

Option 1: internal dns impl that syncs with routes
Option 2: manual
